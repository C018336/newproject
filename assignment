The period of fourth generation was from 1971 to present. The fourth generation computers was developed using microprocessor. Intel 4004 chip was the first microprocessor developed in 1971. The microprocessor is a silicon chip contains millions of transistors that was designed using LSI and VLSI technology. 
The microprocessor is a silicon chip contains millions of transistors that was designed using LSI and VLSI technology.

The fourth generation computers used LSI (Large Scale Integration) and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology. Using LSI and VLSI technology thousands of transistors are integrated on a small silicon chip. In fourth generation computers the semiconductor memory is replaced by magnetic core memory resulting in fast random access to memory.
Several operating systems like MS-DOS and MS windows developed during this time. The instructions to the computer were written in high level language instead of machine language and assembly language.
Advantages

    More reliable than previous generation computers.
    Perform calculations in Picoseconds.
    Consumes less power than the previous generation computers.
    No air conditioning is required.
    Totally general purpose.
    Cost is low compared to the previous generation computers.
    All types of high level languages is used for fourth generation computers.
    Maintenance cost is low compared to the previous generation computers.
    Fourth generation computers are portable.
    Generates less heat than the previous generation computers.
    Learning high level language is easier than assembly and machine language.

Disadvantages

    Latest technology was required for manufacturing of microprocessors.
